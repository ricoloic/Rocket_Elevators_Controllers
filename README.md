# An **INSANE** algorithm, a bit like Me

Hi, So now that we are in Odyssey what is there to do ? **WEEK 3 - ELEVATORS CONTROLLERS ALGORITHMS** An algorithm what for ? Not again with the elevator theme ? All right, let's see what we're dealing with here. Mmmm, so you're telling me I have to control all the elevators in a building, oh you shouldn't have. **Moua ha ha**, Just kidding. This was a really intensive week for my brain. It will have been the biggest brainteaser my brain has ever had to solve. A lightweight algorithm you say, well that's not what my algorithm is, but if we're talking about its ability to solve an elevator request problem, let me tell you that it is more than capable of solving the scenarios given by the Codeboxx team.

## A BRIEF explanation of the algorithm

We were also asked to make a video with a maximum time of 5 minutes to explain our algorithm, well there it is but if you really want to understand the utilization and the capability of the algorithm you'll have to look at its inside

 > ##### Little hint, the algorithm is mostly in the pointing system and in the addition of the stop to the elevator
