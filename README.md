# An **INSANE** algorithm, a bit like Me
Hi, So now that we are in Odyssey what is there to do ? **WEEK 3  - ELEVATORS CONTROLLERS ALGORITHMS** An algorithm what for ? Not again with the elevator theme ? All right, let's see what we're dealing with here. Mmmm, so you're telling me I have to control all the elevators in a building, oh you shouldn't have. **Moua ha ha**, Just kidding. This was a really intensive week for my brain. It will have been the biggest brainteaser my brain has ever had to solve. A lightweight algorithm you say, well that's not what my algorithm is, but if we're talking about its ability to solve an elevator request problem, let me tell you that it is more than capable of solving the scenarios given by the Codeboxx team.

## Language
So trying to figure the basics' of Ruby and Python was pretty simple when you have a good base in JavaScript
